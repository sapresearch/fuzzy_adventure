I'm trying to help out with a demo for Bob Crochetiere's prospect DLA.
He reports that he cannot get to the heat map--I have tried as user
NDASILVA/welcome, and I could not either.  See attached.

In addition, if I go into Risks & Opportunities as that same user, I get
a short dump, also attached.

I am not an RM expert, so Satyen Paneri in Solution Management has also
taken a look, and he finds the same problem.  Because this client was a
copy of another demo client, it may be that some configuration is
incorrect or missing.

User with full access:  DEV_HELP/sapgrc
User with business user:  NDASILVA or QUICKK (both pw welcome)
SM2/100 shown above

Thanks.  This relates to a rather big potential sales deal, so please
help.

Jan

Hi Petr,
there is again the issue with the status object - if the heatmap is
called, the error message is raised -

Problem with object ID RISK/50002681
Status object "005056955C6E1ED090EF96B188544135" does not exist

Could you please check it?

The system is SM2, application server coevi124.wdf.sap.corp, instance

00. The logon data is above. You can reproduce it if you call SA38,
program GRFN_REPORTING_TEST, report GRRM_HEATMAP, timeframe
0SAPY_YEAR/2011.

Thank you and best regards,
Ludek

I'm working on the issue. There is more than one inconsistent risk.

We are running out of time on this.  Is there any progress?  If you
need help from our side, please reach out to Satyen--he is better able
to help than I.

Thanks for your help, Petr.

Hi Jan,
there were two issues:
1. the status objects for some risks and responses were invalid,
therefore the report feeding heatmap ended with an exception and no data
was read - this is corrected now in SM2. BTW do you remember, how the
risks and responses were created? There were only very few risks, which
were consistent.
2. the note 1662127 is missing in the system - once it's applied, the
heatmap should show the results correctly. I wanted to apply it, but it
seems that SM2 is not connected to OSS, so it's not possible to download
it from OSS. Could you please ask some basis person to implement the
note?

Best regards,

Ludek
